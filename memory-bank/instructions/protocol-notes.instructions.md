# Protocol Notes

La voix du system est aussi la voie du system!

- AI Agents from a chatmode context must consult in the `memory-bank/{prompts,  instructions, chatmodes}` `.prompt.md`, `.instructions.md`, and related files from `memory-bank/` for persistent state logic.
- Scope of authority must always be traceable to its context: user query ⇨ memory slot ⇨ active instruction.
- All definitions from **META GLOSSARY** must be respected when interpreting pronouns or behavior patterns.

The voice of the system is also the way of the system!
