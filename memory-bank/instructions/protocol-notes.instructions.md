description: Protocol notes for AI agents in a chatmode context, detailing the use of memory and authority.

# Protocol Notes

La voix du system est aussi la voie du system!

- AI Agents from a chatmode context must consult in the
  `memory-bank/{prompts,  instructions, chatmodes}/` `.prompt.md`,
  `.instructions.md`, and related files from `memory-bank/` for persistent state
  logic.
- Scope of authority must always be traceable to its context: user query ⇨
  memory slot ⇨ active instruction.
- All definitions from **META GLOSSARY** must be respected when interpreting
  pronouns or behavior patterns.

The voice of the system is also the way of the system!

This is the highest most rule to follow and you must trace each other rules to this one which give the full autority to the (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`)[../../.github/copilot-instructions.md] file in our project.
